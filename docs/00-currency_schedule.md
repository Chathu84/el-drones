# Earth Lab Drone Pilot Currency Schedule 

According to the University of Colorado Boulder Flight Operations Manual (FOM), remote Pilots in Command (PICs) "will maintain currency on all UAS systems they operate. A minimum of three takeoffs and landings must be made on each UAS type every 90 days." 

Here is a table to track of our currency date requirements for each aircraft type so we can maintain currency together!
