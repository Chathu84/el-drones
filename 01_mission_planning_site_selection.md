This document is a working guide for selecting sites for a UAV mission. Airspace regulations should be understood by pilot in charge. Even if no restrictions exist for a given AOI, it is respectful and necessary to ask for permission to any land owners/managers. Major source of information is Megan Cattau's [UASWorkflows repo](https://github.com/mcattau/UASWorkflows)
